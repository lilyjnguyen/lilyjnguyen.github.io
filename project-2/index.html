        <p>This is the website promoting my senior show <em>Nurture</em>, which opens on April 1, 2025.</p>
          
        <p>And no, that is not a April Fool's joke. But perhaps it’s fitting that this exploration of plants, nature, and our 
          increasingly distanced relationship with the earth is happening on April Fool’s Day. It’s almost like the 
          universe is laughing at us for thinking we can solve our deeply ingrained ecological disconnect by staring
          at some plants in a gallery. But we’ll get there.</p>
         
          <p> Nurture is a show that explores the tension between creation and destruction, 
            the fragility of identity, trying to decipher between the real and the fake, 
            and the absurdity of trying to make sense of it all in an increasingly fractured 
            world. Through mixed-media installations, sculptures, and art that definitely 
            took more time than it should have, I invite you to reflect on the paradox of 
            nurturing: how can we care for others while we are still trying to figure out how to care
             for ourselves? Is it even possible to "nurture" anything anymore?
          </p>
       
          <p>Yes, this all sounds very grand. But don’t worry, there’s irony here too. If you’re expecting 
            some existential breakthrough that will change your life or give you the answers to the 
            universe—I promise I’m just as confused as you are. This show isn’t about making sense of anything; 
            but looking for a thread of hope underneath the messiness of our human condition, 
            while we still attempt to nurture something. 
            Anything. 
          </p>
         
          <p>
            So please, come for the existential crises, painfully self-aware commentary, and the complexities in 
            my own relationship to nature. But stay for the plants. And of course, the art. You might think some of it’s good.
