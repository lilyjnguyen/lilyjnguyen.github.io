        <p>This is the website promoting my senior show called Nurture, with its opening reception on April 1, 2025. <br>
          And no, that is not a joke. But perhaps it’s very fitting that this exploration of plants, nature, and our <br>
          increasingly distanced relationship with the earth is happening on April Fool’s Day. It’s almost like the <br>
          universe is laughing at us for thinking we can solve our deeply ingrained ecological disconnect by staring<br>
          at some plants in a gallery. But we’ll get there.</p>
         
          <p> Nurture is a show that explores the tension between creation and destruction, <br>
            the fragility of identity, trying to decipher between the real and the faux, <br>
            and the absurdity of trying to make sense of it all in an increasingly fractured <br>
            world, all through the lens of our relationship to plants and the environment in <br>
            which we live. Through mixed-media installations, sculptures, and art that definitely <br>
            took more time than it should have to finish, I invite you to reflect on the paradox of <br>
            nurturing: how can we care for others when we are still trying to figure out how to care<br>
             for ourselves? Is it even possible to "nurture" anything anymore?<br>
          </p>
       
          <p>Yes, this all sounds very deep. But don’t worry, there’s irony here too. If you’re expecting <br>
            some grand existential breakthrough that will change your life or give you the answers to the <br>
            universe—sorry to disappoint. I’m just as confused as you are, and I’ve been to art school. <br>
            This show isn’t about making sense of anything; it’s about not making sense, which I think is <br>
            much more relatable these days. But underneath it all, there’s a thread of hope—one that comes <br>
            from acknowledging the messiness of our human condition, yet we still attempt to nurture something. <br>
            Anything. 
          </p>
         
          <p>
            So please, come for the existential crises, stay for the painfully aware commentary on my internal <br>
            struggles with my own relationship to nature. And of course, the art. You might think some of it’s good. <br>
            Maybe.
