    <p> The house in which we live has three wings. The west wing
        is where <a href="page2.html" class="husbandroute"> the Husband </a> and I live. The east wing is where the
        children and their attending au pairs live. And lastly, the
        largest but ugliest wing, extending behind the house like a
        gnarled, broken arm, is where my <a href="page6.html" class="boyfriendroute"> 100 ex-boyfriends </a>live.

        We live in LA. It is three in the morning, it is three in the afternoon.
