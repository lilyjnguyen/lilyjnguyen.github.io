<p>The Husband returns home from the investment firm. He comes in quietly, 
through our noiseless garage door. I know it’s him when I hear the sound
of ice clinking against glass, then bourbon pouring, glugging
as it leaves the bottle. He lets it sit for a bit.</p>

<p>
Hi, honey, I say. How was your day?
<br><br>
<em>$$$$, $$$$$$$$$ </em>, he says. <em>$$$$$$$$$$$$$$.</em>
<br><br>
Well, did it go up or down?
<br><br>
<em>$$$$$$$$$$.</em>
<br><br>
Does that mean you’re working this weekend?
<br><br>
<em>$.</em>

<p>The Husband is a resting place. He is a chair. Sometimes
I drape myself over him and I get the physical comfort of not
being alone. I can feel it anytime I want; mostly Saturday
nights, mostly Sunday mornings. But the times I need it
most are the early evenings when I feel like I am dissolving.
During this time, my ex-boyfriends scatter, and The Husband and I go somewhere <a href="page5.html"> for dinner</a>. </p>
