<p>The Husband orders a red wine and I order a Diet Coke.
Plates are laid out: tuna carpaccio encrusted with toasted
sesame seeds, pea shoot tendrils tenderly clasping veal
medallions in abstracted herb sauce, zucchini slivers
dressed with mint-dill reduction.</p>

<p>The Husband sips his wine, eats his veal while I tell him
about the things <a href="page6.html"> my ex-boyfriends and I did </a> all day, the art
we saw, the items we bought. He nods his head to a 
rhythm different than the conversation.</p>

<a href="page10.html"> He's being quieter than usual.</a>

<p>Dessert finally arrives, a vanilla torte
with raspberry coulis and mascarpone cream.</p>

<p>I try to enjoy it, but I can’t seem to escape the gaze of
the couple at the next table. The wife, she can’t help herself.
She leans over, puts her hand on my wrist, says, You will
produce beautiful children. 
<br><br>
That’s been done, I tell her, taking my hand away.</p>

<p>I have one son and one daughter, one gang-bangingly
after the other. One is six and the other seven. They look
and act so much like the Husband. They chew with their
mouths closed, they know the correct fork to use. At night,
they crawl into my lap, full of easily disclosed secrets, light
as folding chairs.</p>
