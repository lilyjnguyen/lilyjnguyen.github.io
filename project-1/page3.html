<p>On our first date, I wore suede Ferragamo pumps, several
inches high, the same pair I had worn to college graduation.
They were the nicest pair of anything I owned.
In his darkened, curtained apartment, he asked me to
take them off.</p>

<p>He said, <em>Letâ€™s see how tall you really are.</em>
<br><br>
You want me to take my shoes off? I asked.</p>

<p>It was three in the afternoon. He lived on one of the top
floors of a downtown high-rise. The air was stale, as if the
place had been uninhabited for long periods of time. He hadn't spent much time at home, he had told me, because his
job at the investment firm <a href="page4.html"> <em> ******** </em> </a> had been so demanding recently.
He held my hands as I stepped out of the Ferragamos, and I revealed myself to be very small.</p>
