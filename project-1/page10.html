    <p>It takes five minutes to vacuum a room, but there are
    100 rooms. 
    <br><br>
    I am on door three when, through the din of the
    vacuum roar, I hear a sound, faint and shaky, like the
    tinkling of change in a pocket.</p>
    <div class="hcry1"> <em>¢¢¢¢ ¢¢¢.</em></div>

    <p>I turn the vacuum off. It’s so faint, I strain to <br> hear it.</p>
    
    <div class="hcry2"> <em>¢¢ ¢¢¢ ¢¢¢¢¢.</em></div>
    
    <p>I walk around, opening up rows of doors to reveal empty
    rooms, trying to follow the sound.</p>
    
    <div class="rtext">Hello? </div>

    <p>I open up doors four, five, and six. Nothing. I keep going. Seven, eight,
    nine. It’s not until door forty-nine that I find him: The
    Husband, sitting in an old armchair. It’s been a while. Even
    with his hands covering his face, I can see that he has aged,
    with a lightning-bolt streak of silver in his hair. He wears a
    sweater vest; he crosses his legs. When he looks up, I see
    that his face is wet, is pained. </p>
    
    <div class="htext"> <em>¢¢ ¢¢¢ ¢¢¢.</em></div>
   
    <p>It is the sound of
    delicate, fawn-like tears streaming down his craggy
    mountain of a face, strewn with white whiskers.
    Head lowered, I kneel in front of him, take his moist
    hands in mine.</p>
   
    <div class="rtext"> I was calling you. Why didn’t you answer? 
    <br><br>
    What’s wrong?</div>
  
    <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
    <div class="htext"></p><em>$$$.</em></div>
    <br>
    <div class="rtext">Well, it’s obviously not nothing.</div>
    <br><br>
    <div class="htext"><em>$$$$$$$$$$$.</em></div>
    <br><br> 
    <div class="rtext">Of course I know your name.</div>
    <br><br>
    <div class="htext"><em>$$$$$$. $$$$$$$$$$.</em></div>
    <br><br> <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
    <div class="rtext">Of course I remember.</div>
