<p>Aaron. Adam. Akihiko.
Alejandro. Anders. Andrew. Those are just the As.</p>

<p>My <a href="page7.html">100 ex-boyfriends and I hang out every day</a>. We get
into the Porsche 911 Turbo S, bunching into it as if it were a
clown car, and drive down roads and boulevards, hills and
canyons, palm-frond-strewn avenues, and parking garages
of shopping malls. Geoff drives. The city sprawls out
endlessly. Bougainvillea the color of bruises grows across
peopleâ€™s fences. Sometimes, a bamboo grove. Sometimes, a
cemetery. Sometimes, a free clinic devoted to the removal
of burst capillaries.</p>

<p>The sun hits our faces, our eyes squint
in the light, our hair billows in the wind. I am happy.</p>
