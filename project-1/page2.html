   <p> 
    I first met The Husband on LoweredExpectations.com. He
    was the first guy I met after creating a profile, and <a href="page3.html" class="husbandroute"> 
    the first date I went on that year. </a>
    
    
   <P>Under Favorite Foods I put:  
    <br>
    <em>tacos</em>. 
    </P> 
  
    <p>
    Under Favorite Music I put: 
    <br>
    <em>Cat Power</em>.
    </p>    

    <p>I put down all the taste qualifiers that were supposed
    to bridge the gap between myself and someone else. 
    
   <p>
    Under What Iâ€™m Looking For I put: 
    <br>
    <em>  I want to know someone for
    longer than a few years. I want to know what that feels like.
    I also want not to flee. By that I mean I want constancy. I
    want to be constant. </em>
