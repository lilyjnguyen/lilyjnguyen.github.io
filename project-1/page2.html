   <p> I first met The Husband on LoweredExpectations.com. He
    was the first guy I met after creating a profile, and <a href="page3.html"> the first date I went on that year. </a>
    Under Favorite Foods I put: <em>tacos</em>. Under Favorite Music I put: <em>Cat Power</em>. I put down all the taste qualifiers that were supposed
    to bridge the gap between myself and someone else. </p>
    
   <p> Under What Iâ€™m Looking For I put: <em>I want to know someone for
    longer than a few years. I want to know what that feels like.</em>
    I also want not to flee. By that I mean I want constancy. I
    want to be constant.</p>
