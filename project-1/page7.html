<p>On <a href="page2.html"> The Husband’s</a> credit card: 101 burgers at Umami
Burger, 101 admission tickets to LACMA, 101 golden milks
at Moon Juice. We go shopping. We go to Barneys. We go to
Koreatown. We go to Urth Caffé to do some light reading.</p>

<br><br>
<em>Does this hoodie make me look fat?</em>  Fred says.
<br><br>
<em>It’s almost time for us to go home,</em> Chang says. <em> <a href="page8.html">The kids still have homework to do.</a></em>
<br><br>
